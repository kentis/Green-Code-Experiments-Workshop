# Q3: Parsing dates in Java

In Java there are several ways to parse strings into Date objects. In this experiment we will check the execution times of parsing 10000 dates by using each of the following classes:

* java.time.LocalDate
* java.time.LocalDateTime
* java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter

The code for the experiment is available in the file DateParsingBenchmark.java. Run the program several times and vary the order of each of the methods in order to ensure consistent results and reduce sources of bias.
