# Design of Q1 Value Inside or Outside Loops

We will examine this question in the context of Python and Java. 

The Python experiment will be a CLI program that executes two loops. The first loop will use a variable instantiated outside of itself and add it to another variable a number of times. The second loop will instantiate the variable inside of the loop and then add it to the value of another variable. Each loop will be timed and the time it takes will be printed. It is important to execute the program several times and vary the order of the two loops to ensure consistent and unbiased results.

The dotnet experiment will do essentially the same thing as the Python experiment above, except in C#. To run this experiment, navigate to the `dotnet` folder and run

```
dotnet run
```
